# Abstract
The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the time difference between running a python program on the CPU vs. on the GPU when calculating the result of a complex math function. We describe the algorithm implementation, along with the math function used in the program. Next, we present the results of the experiments. In the end, we define a linear regression model for determining the time taken to finish the calculation of arbitrary input size.
